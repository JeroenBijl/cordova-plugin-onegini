# Release notes 5.x

## 5.0.1

### Bug fixes

- The plugin will limit the number of IntentFilters that are added to the app's AndroidManifest file. If you use the
Onegini SDK Configurator you should also update it to the 4.2.1 version. Some IntentFilter duplications are still
possible, caused by a [cordova bug](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-13486)

## 5.0.0

### Features
- Added custom registration feature

### Improvements
- [`Android`] Updated the Onegini Android SDK to v9.0.0.
- [`iOS`] Updated the Onegini iOS SDK to v8.0.0.
- Removed support for FIDO authenticators

### Bug fixes
- Fixed an error where the UserProfile was not correctly passed in the `onSuccess` event of the `onegini.user.register()` method.
